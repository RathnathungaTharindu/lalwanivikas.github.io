	<div class="about">
		
		<p>I am Vikas Lalwani and I like programming in JavaScript. â€‹Currently I use plain JavaScript or <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> in most of my projects, but I plan to learn React as well in near future. I like spending my time making <a href="/projects/">small projects</a> because creating new things makes me happy.</p>
		
		<p>I don't know everything, but I know enough to be able to figure rest of the stuff out. And I like figuring things out on my own.</p>

		<p>This website contains my journey on the web in the form of my <a href="/writing.html">guest contributions</a>, <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, and <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
		
		<p>I am always on the lookout for exciting new projects. Feel free to reach out if you have some interesting ideas that you would want me to work on, or if you want to collaborate with me on a project. Or to just say hi!</p>
